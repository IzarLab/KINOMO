# A Kernel dIfferentiability correlation-based NOn-negative Matrix factorization algorithm using Kullback-Leibler divergence loss Optimization (KINOMO)

We propose Kernel dIfferentiability correlation-based NOn-negative Matrix factorization algorithm using Kullback-Leibler divergence loss Optimization (KINOMO), a semi-supervised NMF model that is robust to noises and also used ‘prior’ biological knowledge for better refinement.
