# A Kernel dIfferentiability correlation-based NOn-negative Matrix factorization algorithm using Kullback-Leibler divergence loss Optimization (KINOMO)

We propose Kernel dIfferentiability correlation-based NOn-negative Matrix factorization algorithm using Kullback-Leibler divergence loss Optimization (KINOMO), a semi-supervised NMF model that is robust to noises and also uses ‘prior’ biological knowledge for better refinement.

#Instructions for running KINOMO

#Accessing the KINOMO repository

1. The KINOMO repsository can be accessed via https://github.com/IzarLab/KINOMO.git
2. Download the KINOMO repository into your local machine.


#Running KINOMO
1. Detailed step-by-step instructions/help (in R) for running KINOMO is specified in the 'kinomo_run.R'. Please use this script.
2. If there is any error with respect to accessing specific sub-scripts/modules, please provide necessary path-to-file information.
3. 

#
#Convert the gene expression data (raw counts) to Seurat object and perform necessary normalization, scaling etc.
#Run the following R script

#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

Please see/use 'kimono_run.R' for running NMF.
